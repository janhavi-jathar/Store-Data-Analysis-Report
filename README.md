# Store-Data-Analysis-Report
This project involves a detailed analysis of Online Sales Data of a store in India for the year 2022. Leveraging Excel and pivot tables, an interactive dashboard was created to visualize key insights and trends.

## Key Questions Explored
- Which month recorded the highest sales in 2022?
- Who made more purchases: men or women?
- What are the different order statuses in 2022?
- Which states had the highest sales?
- Is there a relationship between age and gender based on the number of orders?
- Which sales channel contributed the most to overall sales?

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
To ensure data integrity, I meticulously cleaned the dataset by addressing missing or null values, standardizing formats, and creating new columns for age groups and months. Through this process, I transformed the data into a format conducive to in-depth analysis.

## Analysis Approach
Utilizing pivot tables, I designed insightful visualizations that facilitated a deeper understanding of sales trends and patterns.

## Key Insights
Based on the visualization analysis, the following key insights were derived:

- The month of March 2022 emerged as the peak period for sales, recording the highest sales volume.
- Women constituted a larger portion of the customer base compared to men, indicating a significant preference for online purchases among female consumers.
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh emerged as the top three states in terms of sales, highlighting regional variations in purchasing behavior.
- The age group between 30 to 49 years contributed the most to the store's sales, signifying the importance of targeting middle-aged demographics in marketing strategies.
- Major sales channels, including Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, played pivotal roles in driving overall sales, underscoring the significance of online platforms in facilitating transactions.

These insights provide valuable guidance for strategic decision-making and marketing efforts to further enhance sales performance and target specific customer segments effectively.

## Conclusion
This project not only provided valuable insights into online sales performance but also demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis and visualization techniques using Excel.
